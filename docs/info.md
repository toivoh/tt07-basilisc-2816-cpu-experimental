## Overview

Basilisc-2816 v0.1 is a small 2-bit serial 2/8/16 bit processor that fits into one Tiny Tapeout tile.
The CPU has been designed around the constraints of

- small area,
- 4 pin serial memory interface to a RAM emulator implemented in a RP2040 microcontroller, which can be supported by the RP2040 microcontroller on the Tiny Tapeout 06 Demo Board.

and a later version is intended to be included in the next version of the AnemoneGrafx-8 retro console https://github.com/toivoh/tt06-retro-console (motivating the constraints).

Features:

- 2-bit serial execution:
	- ALU operations etc are calculated 2 bits/cycle
	- 2-bit-serial register file with two read/write ports realized as a bank of shift registers
	- Saves area compared to processing 8/16 bits per cycle
	- No point in calculating faster than the memory interface allows
- 8x 8-bit registers that can be paired into 4x 16-bit registers
- 16 bits/instruction (some instructions might take an additional 16 bit immediate)
- 64 kB address space
- Quite regular and orthogonal instruction encoding
- Many addressing modes
- Variable shift instructions
- 8x8 and 8x16 bit multiply instructions, producing 2 result bits per cycle like everything else
- 13 branch conditions + relative call
- Instruction prefetch queue

This is the v0.1c experimental version, which

- is hardened using OpenLane 2,
- uses latches for the prefetch queue and instruction register,
- includes the `mul` instruction, and
- has a prefetch queue of 4 instruction words.

The usage of latches is experimental, but allows to pack in more features.
The v0.1a version can be found at https://github.com/toivoh/tt07-basilisc-2816-cpu.
